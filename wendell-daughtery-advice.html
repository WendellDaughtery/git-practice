                    Finding meaning in learning is the key.<br><br>

                    <li>
                        Make real life connections with the new information and see how it fits in with what else you
                        know.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The key is to interact with the information. Using multiple sources will help you with this.
                        Along with books, gather relevant videos, podcasts, movies, and blogs as well.

                    Spend More Time Practicing Things You Find Difficult

                <ul>
                    <li>Practice in itself is great, but in order to excel at any skill, you need to push yourself
                        out of your comfort zone and practice things you aren't good at. This is known as deliberate
                        practice.
                    </li>
                    <li>Concentration is important while practicing. If your mind is wandering, not much learning
                        will
                        happen.
